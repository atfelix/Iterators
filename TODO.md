# Todo iterators and sequences

- Consider adding some of the string iterators that Rust has as well
- Consider adding lazy exact and inexact sequence for strings to that the iterator products `Substring`s or `String`s instead of `[String.Element]?`
- Make types / extension methods publicly available
- Add documentation each type
